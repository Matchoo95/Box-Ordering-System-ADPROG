# Box Ordering System
Advance Programming Concepts Coursework programmed in Java

This is a piece of coursework for our programming unit at university. We used google drive to manage our versions and have just used github so that future employers/other programmers can see our work (therefore workload is not spread evenely). Both of the contributers here worked on the about 50% each of the project and we had one more team mate who focused on the designs.

This program acts as a simple program that allows a user to select what type of cardboard box to by and then output a price depending on want they want. "FinalBoxQuote V-12" is our final version of this program.
